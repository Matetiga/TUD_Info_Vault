## (RSA Algorithm)
- GoodNotes ->Diskrete Strukturen S. 178
- generate private and public keys that are mathematical linked 
---

### Example 
Alice and Bob
- both have their own private and public keys 
- they exchange only their public keys 

Alice sends a message to Bob **encrypted with Bob's public key**
- Only Bob (**with his private key**) can **decrypt** the message 

if an attacker were to steal Alice's private key, they could see **all the messages received by Alice but not messages sent by Alice**\
