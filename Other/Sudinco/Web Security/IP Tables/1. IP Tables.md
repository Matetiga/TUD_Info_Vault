Like a security guard that **decides which data packets can enter or leave the network**
[IPTables - Doc](https://www.acens.com/comunicacion/wp-content/images/2014/07/wp-acens-iptables.pdf)
## Architecture
### Chains
each chain is responsible for a specific task
- **input**
	- to open/block a port
- **forward**
	- responsible for packet forwarding
	- tr√°fico que atraviesa nuestro equipo y es reenviado a otro
- **output**
	- responsible for web browsing 
	- can't send a single package without this chain allowing it

- **prerouting**
	- decides what happens to a package as soon as it enters the network
	- altering the package 
	- dropping the package
	- do nothing and let it slip
- **postrouting**
	- where packages leave their first trace, before leaving the computer

### Tables
- Filter
	- for filtering and *restricting* *packages* **to/from** the computer
	- ports can be blocked with it
- [[NAT - Sudinco]]
- Mangle 
	- for changing something inside the package before coming in or leaving out
- Raw
	- deals with raw packages
- Security
	- [[SELinux]]


### Targets
specify where the a package should go 
- ACCEPT 
- DROP 
- RETURN
- DNAT, MASQUERADE, LOG, REJECT,SNAT, TRACE, TTL
