**Transmission Control Protocol**
Handles packet ordering and error checking

### IP and TCP 
Is like sending a puzzle through the mail to some one 
- **IP:** has the information of where the pieces should go (destination information)
- **TCP:** ensures that the pieces of the puzzle (the packages), that are sent separately through different ways to the destiny, **are received by the target**, **are complete** and **if not, let the sender know that the packages are incomplete** and **asks packages to be resent** 

Both are used in conjunction to maintain connection between the client and server and to ensure packet order 
- TCP maintains the connection with the sender from before the first puzzle piece is sent to after the final piece is sent
