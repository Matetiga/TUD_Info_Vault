**Transport Layer Security**
[[TLS Handshake]]

Works the same (encrypting data between server and client ) as the [[SSL]]

---

## Working Method
### Encryption
- hides data being transferred
### Authentication 
- ensures parties exchanging information are who they claim to be
### Integrity 
- ensures that the transferred information is not manipulated

---

## Using a TLS 
- get a TLS/[[SSL Certificate]] and install it on the origin server
