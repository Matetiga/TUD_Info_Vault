- process between two communicating devices to ensure the identity of both 
	- (both devices are who they claim to be)

*Occur after a [[Other/Sudinco/Web Security/TCP]] Connection has been opened*

## TCL Handshake Steps 
- 1. **Client Hello:** client and server specify TLS version (initiates the handshake), and sends *client random* 
- 2.  **Server Hello:** server responds with a message containing [[SSL Certificate]], chosen <span style="color:#ffff00">cipher suite,</span> *sends server random* 

- 3. authenticate identity of the server ([[SSL Certificate]]) with the certificate authority that issued it 
	- => confirms that the server is who it claims to be
- 4. generate session keys to use symmetric encryption  (*premaster secret*)
	- => *premaster secret* is a random string of bytes that is encrypted with the public key and can be decrypted with the private key by the server
- 5. server decrypts premaster secret 
- 6. Session keys created: **Both client and server generate session keys** from the *client random*, the *server random*, and the premaster secret. They should arrive at the same results
- 7. client and server are ready: both send the *finished message* **encrypted with the session key**

##### Client random 
- is a random number generated by the client and sent to the server
- ensures that a connection between client and server is unique
##### Server random 
- is a random number generated by the server and sent to the client 

###### Both client and server random ensures that the session key is unique and secure

## Cipher Suite 
- set of algorithms used to establish secure communications connection 
- specifies which encryption keys and session keys will be used
