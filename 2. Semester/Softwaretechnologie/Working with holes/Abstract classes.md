- Abstract classes have [[Abstract Methods]]
- Abstract classes can implement [[Interfaces]]

###### This allows classes to be grouped by a common factor

### Suitable for scenarios where there is a clear hierarchical relationship between classes
---
## Purpose
#### Work as blueprints for "normal" classes
- Abstract methods must be inherit by subclasses in order to use them
- Can also have concrete methods
---

## Inheritance:
A Subclass can inherit only one abstract class

---
## Constructors
- can have constructors => be extended (*extends*)
- can be instantiated (but not directly)
---
## Accessibility
- Method and fields can be defined (public, private, protected, default)
