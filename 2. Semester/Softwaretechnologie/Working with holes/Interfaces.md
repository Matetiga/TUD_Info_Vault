[[Abstract classes]]

### Suitable for scenarios where multiple unrelated classes need to exhibit similar behavior
## Purpose
- Interfaces define a contract for classes to implement                      => a class must implement a set of methods
- Used to define contract and promote polymorphism 
---
## Inheritance
- A class can inherit **multiple interfaces**

---
## Implementation
- Cannot contain any method implementations
- <span style="color:#ffff00">Only method signatures</span> 
---
## Constructor
- Cannot have constructors => Cannot be instantiated

---
## Accessibility
- All method are (implicitly) public and abstract
