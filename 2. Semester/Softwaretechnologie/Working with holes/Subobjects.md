When a subclass inherits form a superclass, it also inherits it's objects

---
### For example:
if class `B` inherits from class `A`, objects of class `B` include all the attributes and behaviors of class `A`, making the `A` part of `B` a subobject.

###### if a `Car` class contains instances of `Engine`, `Wheel`, and `Body` classes, each of these instances can be considered a subobject of the `Car`.
