## Code implementation
```Java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

// Class Room
public class Room {
    private String name;

    public Room(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}

// Class House (Composition Relationship)
public class House {
    private String address;
    private List<Room> rooms; // House contains rooms, and rooms cannot exist independently

    public House(String address) {
        this.address = address;
        this.rooms = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void addRoom(String roomName) {
        Room room = new Room(roomName); // Room is created within House, demonstrating composition
        rooms.add(room);
    }

    public List<Room> getRooms() {
        return rooms;
    }

    public String getAddress() {
        return address;
    }
}
