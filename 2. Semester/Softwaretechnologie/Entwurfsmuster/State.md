#### Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes


### Context
- maintains a reference to the current state of the object
- provides an interface for clients to interact with (to change the object's state)

### State:
defines an interface of the behavior to be implemented
- allows the "Context" to interact with state objects without knowing their type
