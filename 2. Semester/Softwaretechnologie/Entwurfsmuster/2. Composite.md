## Definition:
- refers to the practice of **designing your classes to use other classes** by **including instances of those classes** as members
- This is in <span style="color:#ffff00">contrast to inheritance</span>, where a class would extend another class to gain its behavior.

---
## Views are nested
- composite represents trees
- Compositum unifies access to root, inner nodes and leaves for a client class![[Screenshot from 2024-05-14 15-32-26.png]]
It is **useful** for: 
- working with a <span style="color:#ffff00">hierarchical collection</span> of interchangable objects

```Java
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

// Component
interface Graphic {
    void draw();
}

// Leaf
class Line implements Graphic {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Draw a line.");
    }
}

// Leaf
class Text implements Graphic {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Draw a text.");
    }
}

// Composite
class CompositeGraphic implements Graphic {
    private List<Graphic> children = new ArrayList<>();

    public void add(Graphic graphic) {
        children.add(graphic);
    }

    public void remove(Graphic graphic) {
        children.remove(graphic);
    }

    public void draw() {
        for (Graphic graphic : children) {
            graphic.draw();
        }
    }
}
```
